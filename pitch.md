## Connecting External IdPs to FreeIPA with Ansible and OAuth

In this session, we'll dive into the world of automated identity management
solutions. FreeIPA is already a powerful tool, but how do we seamlessly connect
it with external identity providers like Google, GitHub, or any other OAuth
provider?

## Why Is This Relevant?
Managing identities is often complex and time-consuming. In many environments,
identities already exist in external systems, and you don't want to duplicate
them. We'll explore how to use FreeIPA as a central service provider to delegate
authentication to these external IdPs. This allows users to use their existing
logins while we simultaneously control access centrally in FreeIPA.

## What We Will Cover in This Session:

- FreeIPA and Ansible Basics:
We'll start with a brief introduction to why this combination is so efficient.

- OAuth and Device Authorization Grant:
We'll clarify the concepts behind this secure connection.

- Practical Application with Ansible Roles: 
I'll show you how to automate and make the configuration reproducible with a
special Ansible role. This isn't just about theoryâ€”it's about the actual code.

- Discussion and Problem-Solving:
After a brief presentation of the technical implementation, the floor is open
for your questions, ideas, and challenges.

## Who Should Attend?
This talk is for DevOps engineers, system administrators, and anyone interested
in automated infrastructure and centralized identity management.
